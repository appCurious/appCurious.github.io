          I am interested in web technologies.  I got started in this industry by asking the recursive questions, "What is this?  How can I use it?  How can I use it anywhere on any device?"
          Here I am today, still asking those quesions that drive my iterative growth cycles.

          I'm still curious about technology.  I'm still learning, growing and failing forward.
